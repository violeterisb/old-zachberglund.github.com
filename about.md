I am a composer, audio designer, teacher, and performer. I compose for video games, movies, and for the sake of creating the art of music. I love the journeys, adventures, and wonderful experiences music and video games bring me through every day. I hope to one day convey my love of music with others, composing, and give them the very same love and appreciation I have for music and video games. 

Currently, I am a Composition major at the University of Northern Colorado and am putting all my effort into learning how to be a better musician, and enjoying the work, music, friendships, and the experiences it brings me. I am spending my school time learning how to write better for instruments and in as many styles as possible so I will be equipped to fit any setting in games, film, or any other job I might have, the best I see possible. 

As an important note: I am very nearly done with my education. If you are interested in my skills and musical works, send me an email and I can show you what I've done. Doing whatever it is I need to do is always of the utmost importance to me, and I have been making sure I finish writing the highest quality music I can while still in school. This has left me without the most updated website.
