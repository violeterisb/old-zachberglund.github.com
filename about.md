I am a young composer, performer, and all-around musician in the midst of studying music. I aspire to compose for video games, movies, and for the sake of my love of music. I love the journeys, adventures, and wonderful experiences music brings me through, whether it's from my own life experiences or someone sharing their own life experiences through music. I hope to one day convey my love of music with others, composing, and give them the very same love and appreciation I have for beautiful music. 

Currently, I am a Trumpet Performance and Composition major at the University of Northern Colorado and am putting all my effort into learning how to be a better musician, and enjoying the work, music, friendships, and the experiences it brings me. I am spending my school time learning how to write better for instruments and in as many styles as possible so I will be equipped to fit any setting in games, film, or any other job I might have, the best I see possible.
