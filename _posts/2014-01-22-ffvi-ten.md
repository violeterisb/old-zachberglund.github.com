##Terra

[Terra Branford](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6t_uyg_pF8) is in my opinion the most likely candidate for a main protagonist. It is very difficult to state who is the main protagonist, because of how many heroes there are and how much of an important role the majority of them have. My first reason for believing that she could be the main protagonist is that she is the first character met in the game (enslaved by the Empire at this point) and she consistently has a very important role throughout. Terra also has the most to explain in the area of plot and story, and because of this, I will more try to explain who she is as a character and the things that were important to her in her journey.

Terra is very powerful and confused woman, and has probably the biggest prominence of a "journey" in this game. The game begins with the Empire controlling her and forcing her to let loose her magical powers (which she has without any form of manipulation to her body with Magicite) on the city of Neshe. Stuff goes down and she is freed from the Empire's control and joins the Returners, because its really the only thing she knows how to do. Her journey from here is all about her figuring out herself, because she really doesn't know anything. She's occasionally awkward, but always powerful and passionate. At one of the big plot points of the game, it is discovered she is half Esper, which both explains why she has her powers, and truly gets the support of the Espers for her and her group of friends. While this does answer her questions about who she is, it really only brings up more questions as she becomes unsure if she can love and have other human emotions. This becomes so bad that once Celes and Sabin try to recruit everyone back to fight Kefka after the end of the world, she does not join at first. She isn't even completely sure at first why she doesn't want to fight besides she wants to take care of the children calling her "mama". When a monster comes to attack the town, Terra fails to stop it, and Celes and Sabin hold it back, giving enough time for the injured Terra to heal and figure out what she wants. She does not join until have you return to the town again and the same monster attacks. This time Terra appears in her Esper form and successful stops the monster. At first the children were worried as to who she was, but as soon as she showed her self they realized who she was, and she realized that what she was feeling was love. From that point on love becomes the backbone of why Terra fights Kefka, and she was some quite beautiful lines against Kefka at the end of the game... which I will leave for later.

##Art

![Terra Sprites](http://static3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20121018213931/finalfantasy/images/0/0e/FF6TerraSprites.PNG)
![Terra Esper](http://static3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20121018060204/finalfantasy/images/e/e8/FF6EsperTerraSprites.PNG)

Terra is depicted pretty similarly to Celes in that she is also pretty, powerful-looking, and has a huge look of determination. I find this quite interesting as she is probably the most unsure of her self out of the entire group, and its not till the end that really has that full blown determination. This makes me believe that the Amano artwork is an expression more of her final state. However, the sprites for her show much more of her unsure/confused side. She generally stands with no extreme pose, and while she is armored and looks prepared, she looks almost unsure of standing. Her Esper sprites definitely show the determination and power, as this is where it stems from and she is always at a "crucial" moment when using this.

##Music

In my opinion, Terra's theme can be argued to mean two different things. Terra's theme is the most used theme in the game, as the main melody shows up in quite a few songs, and it becomes the overworld theme (the theme that plays as the player walks around outside of towns) making it probably the most heard song as well. This is another thing that leads me to say that Terra could be the main protagonist. Terra's theme also does a fantastic job of all of these roles. The actual melody and theme of Terra is a very slow progressive melody, and in the case of the actual song "Terra's Theme" (the link) is played on a flute making it feel very calm and almost pastoral. The slow, melodic, and progressive idea that is Terra's theme makes it very easy for it to fit in with a lot other songs and create a sense of continuity in the music. It also works great as a melody over a march-like accompaniment (the A section), truly giving the sense of being on a hero's adventuring, and going a long Terra's journey. The B section, as usual, shows another side of the character, and really expresses her heroic moments and climaxes of her journey with use of a change of instrumentation to more strings and a faster rhythmic feel. In my opinion, the other argument that can be made about Terra's theme is that is actually the theme of the complete, cumulative journey of all of the group. This game was specifically written to be a story about a group of people working together with each individual just as important as the next, and this argument really brings continuity to that idea. While not ruining it in any way, having Terra as the main protagonist would actually lessen the impact of the end of the game (which will be explained in detail on the last post of this series) as one of the most important ideas of the game is the group being a group and not individuals. This would mean that Terra's theme would both simultaneously depict Terra and the party together. Either way I find this theme to be a great piece and quite a great example of how music can be used in video games.
