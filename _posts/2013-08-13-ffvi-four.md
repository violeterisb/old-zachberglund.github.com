###Story

Edgar and Sabin are brothers, and the sons of the previous king of Figaro. They both have quite differently personalities and while their father wanted both of them to share the ruling of Figaro, only Edgar would. They have possibly the least tragic story and a lot less interesting than the others, but Edgar's flirtatious nature and Sabin's serious martial-art focus makes the game quite a bit more interesting. Their drive to hate the Empire comes from their father being poisoned during his time on the throne. In fact this and a few other reasons drove Sabin to want to leave their kingdom with Edgar as well. Edgar could not stand seeing their kingdom fall as they ran away, so he used his rigged coin his father gave him to get Sabin to go free while he ruled the kingdom.
